Definition of BST: A binary tree is a tree structure in which each node has either 0, 1, or 2 children.

This program creates a BST of "Robot" objects with a specific ID, Type, and State. ID's are distinct, randomly generated using the Random Class found in mytest.cpp. States include: ("Alive","Dead"). Robot types include: (BIRD, DRONE, REPTILE, SUB, QUADRUPED).

Objectives:

- Implementing binary search tree (BST) data structures

- Practice Inserting and Removing Objects from tree, then rebalancing the tree

- Practice iterating through the BST and searching for specifc objects in the tree.

- Practice writing rebalancing routines and rotating the BST (Single Left, Single Right, Double Left-Right, Double Right-Left)

- Practice using recursion in programs, Implement Helper functions to carry out Recursive operations

- Using Access Modifiers to set and recieve private member variables

- Display(Dump) objects in the BST

- Practice C++ dynamic memory management, i.e. avoiding memory leaks, avoiding double free, protection against wrong accesses in memory (segmentation fault), etc.
